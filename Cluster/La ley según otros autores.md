...For Suppe (1977, p. 710), the laws for any given theory are “relations over states which determine… possible behaviors of phenomenal systems within the theory’s scope”. For Giere (1999) “what are called laws of nature function ambiguously in the actual practice of science... they are not even candidates for being truths about the world. They are not statements, but general rules for the construction of models”.
