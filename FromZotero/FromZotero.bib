  abstract = {A recently developed asphaltene deposition model is tuned with some experimental data obtained in RealView, a high pressure deposition cell. The tuned model is validated with further experimental data. The lab-scale model is then extended to field-scale tubings and flow lines, and the predicted deposition profile is qualitatively compared with field observations. Finally, an experimental protocol is developed for asphaltene deposition measurement and modeling for flow assurance of tubings and flow lines. The successful applications of RealView in investigating the impacts of shear, run time, residence time, pressure, chemical inhibitor, and surface roughness on the deposition of asphaltenes from five fluids from the Gulf of Mexico are also discussed.}

  abstract = {A regular solution model, previously used to model asphaltene precipitation from Western Canadian bitumens, was tested on four international heavy oil and bitumen samples. The input parameters for the model are the mole fraction, the molar volume, and the solubility parameter for each component. Heavy oils and bitumens were divided into four main pseudo-components, corresponding to the SARA fractions (saturates, aromatics, resins, and asphaltenes). Asphaltenes were divided into fractions of different molar mass, based on a gamma molar mass distribution. The molar volumes and solubility parameters of the pseudo-components were calculated using solubility, density, and molar mass measurements and previously developed correlations. Model predictions were compared with the measured onset and the amount of asphaltene precipitation for solutions of asphaltenes in toluene and n-heptane and for heavy oils diluted with n-alkanes, all under ambient conditions. The overall average absolute deviations (AAD) of the predicted fractional precipitation or yields were {$<$}0.031 for the asphaltene solutions and {$<$}0.008 for the diluted heavy oils. A methodology for characterizing heavy oils and modeling asphaltene precipitation from n-alkane-diluted heavy oils is proposed.}

This definition corresponds to what a laboratory ethnographer may observe concerning research practices in astrophysics. In this field, establishing experimental results or detecting new entities most commonly requires images produced by telescopes functioning on different physical principles. This study will focus on a specific astrophysics paper in order to demonstrate that: (1) images, contrary to what is usually believed, play a central role in the argumentation, with the main text only serving as a long commentary on the images; (2) researchers establish a series of converging proofs in order to elaborate their conclusions. In other words, we will insist on the fact that it is an inter-instrumental procedure that allows the community of researchers to consider their results as true, until proven otherwise, as suggested by the fallibilist perspective which prevails in scientific practice and to which W.C. Wimsatt subscribes.},

  abstract = {Effective separation of water-in-crude oil emulsions is a central challenge for the oil industry on the Norwegian Continental Shelf, especially with the future increase in subsea and even down-hole processing of well fluids. The mechanisms and properties governing emulsion stability are far from fully understood but the indigenous surface active crude oil components are believed to play a major role. In this work a thorough physico-chemical characterisation of a set of crude oils originating from a variety of production fields has been performed. Crude oil properties responsible for emulsion stability were identified by use of multivariate analysis techniques like partial least squares regression (PLS) and principal component analysis (PCA). Interfacial elasticity along with both asphaltene content and asphaltene aggregation state were found to be main contributors to emulsion stability. Information on a crude oils ability to form elastic crude oil-water interfaces was found to be especially crucial when discussing emulsion stability. However, measured values of interfacial elasticity were highly dependent on asphaltene aggregation state. Several experimental techniques was utilised and partly developed for the crude oil characterisation. A high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) scheme was developed for SARA-fractionation of crude oils and an oscillating pendant drop tensiometer was used for characterisation of interfacial rheological properties. For emulsion stability a cell for determining the stability as a function of applied electric fields was used. In addition, near infrared spectroscopy (NIR) was used throughout the work both for chemical and physical characterisation of crude oils and model systems. High pressure NIR was used to study the aggregation of asphaltenes by pressure depletion. A new technique for detection of asphaltene aggregation onset pressures based on NIR combined with PCA was developed. It was also found that asphaltene aggregation is reversible but highly time dependent. Finally, the size of asphaltene aggregates in model systems was estimated by fitting NIR spectra to Rayleigh scattering theory. (Author)},

  abstract = {Petroleum asphaltenes were separated from three different Argentinian crude oils. The asphaltene fractions were extracted by precipitation employing n-pentane and n-heptane solvents, and the coprecipitated resins were removed via Soxhlet extraction. The asphaltenes were characterized by elemental analysis, thermogravimetric analysis, laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, proton nuclear magnetic resonance, powder X-ray diffraction, and Raman spectroscopy. It was found that the asphaltene fractions present both a higher content of heteroatoms and a major degree of aromaticity, when n-heptane is employed. Average structural parameters were obtained by a comprehensive analysis of the experimental data, including those describing the central polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) cores and lateral chains. Thus, a hypothetical average molecular structure is proposed for the Argentinian asphaltenes. The average model molecules have a nucleus of PAHs arranged as pericondensed systems of 4–6 fused aromatic rings, with naphthenic groups and/or alkyl chains of 5–10 carbon long attached.},

  abstract = {Reservoir fluids may present complex phase diagrams involving three-phase behavior, due to the presence of different compounds that -when exceeding certain quantities- can induce the separation of a second liquid phase. Typical and important cases are carbon dioxide, water, and asphaltenes, while the mere asymmetry in the mixture of hydrocarbons can also be responsible for a three-phase region in the fluid phase envelope. Although the behavior and practical implications are quite different in each of these cases, their phase diagrams may share some qualitative characteristics and therefore require similar methods and strategies for their calculation. A general calculation strategy, which includes details about the calculation method for certain types of three-phase envelopes and emphasizes the importance of double saturation points, was presented in a previous publication. The main objective of this study is to explore the different possible topologies that the phase envelope of a reservoir fluid may adopt as a result of compositional changes, when using an equation of state (EOS). Reference fluids (compositional data and parameters) were taken from the literature. Based on these fluids, different alterations in the amounts of defined or pseudo-components of the system were used to analyze their effect on the predicted phase diagram. A new type of behavior was identified, which is included in a classification that currently consists of four different types. Additionally, a complete and updated algorithm is presented, which enables the computation of the different topologies presented in this study. Finally, it is shown that transitions between different types of phase diagram can be observed not only as a consequence of compositional changes but also based on modeling or parametric changes in the description of a given fluid, for example by changing the lumping strategy for the heavy fractions.},

Given this dependency of experiments on computer simulations, that of simulations on models, and that of the models on free parameters, how do researchers establish trust in their experimental results? Using high energy physics (HEP) as a case study, I will identify three different types of robustness that I call conceptual, methodological, and parametric robustness, and show how they can sanction this trust. However, as I will also show, simulation models in HEP themselves fail to exhibit a type of robustness I call inverse parametric robustness. This combination of robustness and failures thereof is best understood by differentiating different epistemic capacities of simulations and different senses of trust: Trusting simulations in their capacity to facilitate credible experimental results can mean accepting them as means for generating belief in these results, while this need not imply believing the models themselves in their capacity to represent an underlying reality.},

Such studies in field science explore phenomena that cannot for practical, technical, or ethical reasons be explored under controlled conditions. These phenomena cannot be fully isolated from their environment or investigated by manipulation or intervention. Yet measurement, including rigorous or clinical measurement, does provide analysts with a sound basis for discerning what occurs under field conditions, and why. In Science Outside the Laboratory, Marcel Boumans explores the state of measurement theory, its reliability, and the role expert judgment plays in field investigations from the perspective of the philosophy of science. Its discussion of the problems of passive observation, the calculus of observation, the two-model problem, and model-based consensus uses illustrations drawn primarily from economics. Rich in research and discussion, the volume clarifies the extent to which measurement provides valid information about objects and events in field sciences, but also has implications for measurement in the laboratory. Scholars in the fields of philosophy of science, social science, and economics will find Science Outside the Laboratory a compelling and informative read.},

  abstract = {Experimental asphaltene precipitation data on several live-oil/solvent mixtures at reservoir conditions were measured to study the effects of temperature, pressure, and composition on precipitate formation and the relationships between critical properties, PVT phase behavior, and precipitate formation. Data generated by the model can be used to identify operating conditions conducive to precipitate formation.Asphaltene precipitation in the reservoir has proved to be a difficult problem to define and study. Field conditions conducive to precipitation include normal depletion, acid stimulation, gas-lift operations, and miscible flooding. Asphaltene precipitation is generally believed to be an irreversible process, which is the main reason it can have a profound impact on production operations. Investigations into asphaltene precipitation have been impeded by a shortage of experimental data and information on precipitation mechanisms. Our investigation included performance of experimental tests to induce and measure precipitation, selection of a thermodynamic model to describe and predict precipitate formation, and performance testing of the model with a variety of reservoir fluids. This paper summarizes the experimental testing, the theory behind the model, and applications of the model to field operations. Relationships observed between the reservoir-fluid phase behavior and the performance of the model are also discussed.Several theories have been proposed to explain why asphaltenes precipitate. For our work, we defined asphaltenes as the portion of the crude oil that is insoluble in heptane yet soluble in benzene or toluene. We selected a model that describes the precipitation mechanism by polymer solution theory. The large asphaltene molecules are similar in structure and behavior to polymer molecules. The remaining components in the rude oil act as a solvent in which the asphaltenes are dissolved or suspended. Hirschberg et al. used this approach in studies conducted by Koninklijke Shell E and P.The overall model depends on two types of fluid equilibria: a vapor/liquid equilibriim (VLE) of the total reservoir fluid and liquid/liquid equilibrium(LLE) between he liquid oil and pseudoliquid asphaltene phases. The VLE of the reservoir fluid is modeled first to obtain the composition and fluid properties of the liquid phase. In the LLE segment of the model, the oil is considered to consist of two liquid phases-an oil-rich phase that acts as the solvent and an asphaltene-rich phase that behaves as the polymer. The term "asphaltenes" actually defines a solubility class of components within the crude oil. Precipitates from a crude oil are classified by the solvent used to induce precipitate formation. For this work, n-heptane was used as the precipitating solvent for asphaltene measurements performed on stock-tank oils.},

It covers the systems approach to understanding sedimentary rocks and their role in evolution and containment of subsurface fluids.  Fundamental aspects of petroleum geology and geochemistry, generation, migration, accumulation, evaluation and production of hydrocarbons are discussed with worldwide examples. Various physical and chemical properties of subsurface waters, crude oils and natural gases are described which is especially important to production engineering. Among various properties of liquid and gaseous hydrocarbons the most important are wettability affecting production characteristics and ultimate recovery: relative permeability affecting reservoir fluid flow to the production wells; density differences between immiscible fluids which affects gravity drainage; viscosity of subsurface fluids affecting the relative mobility of each fluid; and fluid chemistry, which affects the absorption, ultimate recovery and monetary value of produced hydrocarbons.  Discussion of the formation and accumulation of hydrocarbons includes (1) the changes in the chemical composition of hydrocarbons that originate from the debris of living plants and organisms to form crude oil and natural gas; (2) the origin of hydrocarbons in different areas of a single reservoir; (3) the conditions, which determine the distribution of water, oil and gas in the reservoir; (4) the migration of subsurface fluids until they eventually accumulate in isolated traps; (5) discussion of the traps as a function of sedimentary geology and tectonics.

When we draw our image of the world from the way modern science works - as empiricism teaches us we should - we end up with a world where some features are precisely ordered, others are given to rough regularity and still others behave in their own diverse ways. This patchwork makes sense when we realise that laws are very special productions of nature, requiring very special arrangements for their generation. Combining classic and newly written essays on physics and economics, The Dappled World carries important philosophical consequences and offers serious lessons for both the natural and the social sciences.},

More mundanely, we use probabilities to measure capacities, and the assumptions required to ensure that probabilities are a reliable instrument are investigated in the opening chapters of this book, where the early methods of econometrics set a model. The last chapter applies lessons about probabilities and capacities to quantum mechanics and the Bell inequalities. The central thesis throughout is that capacities not only can be admitted by empiricists, but indeed must be - otherwise the empirical methods of modern science will make no sense.},

In this paper, we offer a Bayesian rationalization and defence of the view that robustness analysis can play a confirmatory role, and thereby shed light on the potential of minimal models for hypothesis confirmation. We illustrate our argument by reference to a case study from macroeconomics. At the same time, we also show that there are cases in which robustness analysis is detrimental to confirmation. We characterize these cases and link them to recent investigations on evidential variety (Landes, 2020b, 2021; Osimani and Landes, forthcoming). We conclude that robustness analysis over minimal models can confirm, but its confirmatory value depends on concrete circumstances.},

A first part is devoted to making the point of the different types of strategies based on convergence, providing new distinctions with respect to the existing literature. Specific attention is devoted to robustness vs consilience arguments and one representative example for each category is then discussed in some detail. These are: (a) Perrin’s famous robustness argument on behalf of the atomic hypothesis on the grounds of the concordance of thirteen different procedures to the same result for the Avogadro number; (b) the consilience argument motivating the trust in the viability of the extra-dimension conjecture in the context of early string theory. These two cases are expressly chosen in order to highlight possible differences, also including whether the convergence obtains in terms of empirical or theoretical procedures. Notwithstanding these various differences, in both cases the evaluation of the assessment strategy similarly depends, in a significant way, on how the convergence argument is interpreted, as shown in the final part of the paper.},

Rejecting the version of scientific realism that is concerned with claiming that our theories correspond to an ultimate reality, he proposes instead an 'activist realism': a commitment to do all that we can actually do to improve our knowledge of realities.

  abstract = {Abstract. A generalized predictive model which is based on thermodynamic principle for solid-liquid phase equilibrium has been developed for organic solid precipitation. The model takes into account the effects of temperature, composition, and activity coefficient on the solubility of wax and asphaltenes in organic solutions. The solid-liquid equilibrium K-value is expressed as a function of the heat of melting, melting point temperature, solubility parameter, and the molar volume of each component in the solution. All these parameters have been correlated with molecular weight. Thus the model can be applied to crude oil systems. The model has been tested with experimental data for wax formation and asphaltene precipitation. The predicted wax appearance temperature is very close to the measured temperature. The model not only can match the measured asphaltene solubility data but also can be used to predict the solubility of asphaltene in organic solvents or crude oils. The model assumes that asphaltenes are dissolved in oil in a true liquid state, not in colloidal suspension, and precipitation-dissolution process is reversible by changing thermodynamic conditions. The model is thermodynamically consistent and has no ambiguous assumptions.},

  abstract = {Despite the fact that many publications have dealt with asphaltene onset pressure (AOP) lines during the last 2 or 3 decades, no explicit method for tracing these and other related boundaries from equation of state (EoS) models has been proposed in the literature. In this work, a new integral algorithmic strategy for the construction of complete phase envelope diagrams based on an EoS is presented. The method of Michelsen for tracing two-phase boundaries is used, while for three-phase saturation lines, an equivalent method was designed, including a second set of K factors and a phase fraction as extra independent variables. The double-saturation point is defined, and its importance is highlighted, from both phase behavior and algorithmic perspectives. Specific issues as recognition of unstable segments, such as false bubble curves, are also discussed. Three different fluids from the literature are taken as case studies to illustrate the application of the proposed strategy and discuss different types of behavior. In particular, an unexpected second three-phase region was predicted at higher temperatures in two of the three cases studied. This could serve as inspiration for new experimental studies, to see whether the existence of such a region can be confirmed for some reservoir fluids, or it could be just an artificial behavior predicted by the models. In summary, computer codes based on the proposed strategy might become a useful tool for researchers or professionals dealing with asphaltene phase behavior in reservoir fluids.},

It is further argued that, although Cartwright is a long way from contemporary Humean empiricists, her views can be understood as falling within the broad empiricist tradition.

These sizes are similar to the diameters of the aromatic portion of the unit asphaltene cell as estimated from high-angle X-ray studies, suggesting that the associated aliphatic and naphthenic portions of the molecule must be closely bound to the aromatic nucleus. Evidence for particle association into larger clusters was obtained for the vanadium-enriched asphaltene and from the visbreaker tar, and was also noted in samples prepared from concentrated pyridine solutions. The larger particles (150–300A) observed for the vanadium-enriched asphaltene (Boscan), and to some extent for the Boscan asphaltene itself, are thought to be due to the high metal content. Since the smallest particles observed for the native asphaltene are larger than the minimum resolution of the electron microscope, it seems possible that these particles represent the ultimate unit cells of the asphaltenes.},

After moving to the University of Chicago in 1939, the Cowles Commission sponsored works, many later honored with Nobel Prizes but at the time out of the mainstream of economics, by Haavelmo, Hurwicz and Koopmans on econometrics, Arrow and Debreu on general equilibrium, Yntema and Mosak on general equilibrium in international trade theory, Arrow on social choice, Koopmans on activity analysis, Klein on macroeconometric modelling, Lange, Marschak and Patinkin on macroeconomic theory, and Markowitz on portfolio choice, but came into intense methodological, ideological and personal conflict with the emerging “Chicago school.” This conflict led the Cowles Commission to move to Yale in 1955 as the Cowles Foundation, directed by James Tobin (who had declined to move to Chicago to direct it). The Cowles Foundation remained a leader in the more technical areas of economics, notably with Tobin’s “Yale school” of monetary theory, Scarf’s computable general equilibrium, Shubik in game theory, and later Phillips and Andrews in econometric theory but as formal methods in economic theory and econometrics pervaded the discipline of economics, Cowles (like the Econometric Society) became less distinct from the rest of economics.

  abstract = {Despite the efforts throughout the last few decades, asphaltene deposition remains as one of the greatest challenges in the petroleum industry. In this work, we present a comprehensive series of experimental studies to better understand the asphaltene precipitation, aggregation, and deposition mechanisms. Here, we introduce a simple method to determine the amount of precipitated asphaltene using NIR spectroscopy measurements without the implementation of calibration curves. Moreover, the kinetics of asphaltene precipitation and aggregation is simultaneously investigated by a newly developed, fast, and reliable NIR spectroscopy technique. In the new method, only less than 2\,ml of sample is required for each experiment. In addition, unlike gravimetric techniques, less time consuming and labor-intensive measurements can be performed. In addition, the temperature can be controlled; hence, experiments can be conducted to evaluate the effects of temperature and the driving force on the kinetics of asphaltene precipitation and aggregation. Subsequently, the quantified precipitated asphaltene amount can be used to calibrate the precipitation and aggregation kinetic parameters of the asphaltene deposition model. The results obtained from the kinetics experiments facilitate in establishing a function to scale the precipitation kinetic parameter from laboratory-scale experiments to real field high-pressure high-temperature conditions. Additionally, a multi-section stainless steel packed bed column is proposed to study asphaltene deposition at high temperature and under dynamic conditions. In these experiments, the amount of deposited asphaltene is directly quantified. The results from the packed bed column deposition tests can be used to calibrate the deposition kinetic parameter of the asphaltene deposition model.},

  abstract = {A new technique for the determination of the onset of asphaltene flocculation has been developed through accurate viscosity measurements of a crude oil being diluted with a precipitating agent (n-pentane, n-heptane, n-nonane). This detection method is based on experimental observations of an increase in the viscosity of a crude oil-asphaltene-precipitating agent suspension in which asphaltene particle aggregation occurs. The key point in this development is the phenomenon of asphaltene flocculation induced by the addition of a n-paraffin hydrocarbon (i.e. n-heptane, n-pentane, n-nonane) to crude oil. The onset of asphaltene flocculation is detected graphically, and its location is enhanced by comparison of the analyte curve with a reference system. The reference system was developed using polar and non-precipitating solvents (i.e. toluene, benzene, THF).},

  abstract = {In his 1995 book, The Mangle of Practice,~Andrew Pickering distinguished between representationalist and performative idioms in philosophy of science. While the former describes science as mainly a theoretical enterprise, the latter represents science as a collection of practices. The two perspectives outline two kinds of epistemologies presenting different philosophical concerns. In fact, in a scientific world where entities are not only thought or represented but touched, used, and transformed, the question about their existence does not really matter. What does matter though is to what extent we can extrapolate, from all our experimental material activities, the “real” working of the natural processes. In this chapter, drawing on Pickering's insights,~we introduce a particular kind of performative epistemology fit for grasping how experimental biologists produce reliable knowledge. We argue that experimental biology can be mapped through four principal points: constrained action, standardization, epistemic “tightening,” and extrapolation. We show that each point presents its own proper problems, assumptions, and epistemic challenges. All together, the points define what we call the Epistemic Experimental Space (EES), i.e., the space in which experimental knowledge is produced, assessed, and validated. Without the pretention to be exhaustive, we also~identify some of the main conditions making experimental knowledge in biology a highly consistent, reliable, and successful epistemic activity.},

  abstract = {Crude oils can be described compositionally by a number of methods. SARA analysis is widely used to divide crude oil components according to their polarizability and polarity using a family of related analytical techniques. Problems arise because the analytical techniques do not necessarily produce identical results. Users of the data, however, rarely distinguish between the different techniques, assuming that SARA fraction values generated by any of the commonly used methods are essentially interchangeable. We examine this assumption for medium gravity crude oils and three SARA analysis methods:\, gravity-driven chromatographic separation, thin-layer chromatography (TLC), and high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). Results for a suite of six crude oil samples show that a significant volume of volatile material that contains both saturates and aromatics is lost in the TLC analysis. An improved HPLC method is introduced that gives analyses comparable to the ASTM-recommended chromatographic method in less time than that required for TLC analysis. An internal consistency test is recommended for evaluating SARA fraction data.}

It is therefore necessary to investigate the potential for asphaltene deposition prior to field development. Reliable techniques for detection of asphaltene precipitation are needed in order to test existing theoretical models. The available experimental techniques are elaborate and not suited for high pressure work. A novel technique to determine asphaltene precipitation and relative amounts precipitated is presented. The technique is based on measurement of electrical conductivity, of the crude oil. It is seen that the electrical conductivity changes abruptly at the point of precipitation. Both gravimetric analysis and microscopy has been used to verify the results obtained by conductivity. The principle has been checked for a number of oils with varying asphaltene content from 0.3wt\% to 9wt\%. Results from four different oils are reported.},

However, "simulation" could be seen as a core concept that is in fact used in the in vivo - in vitro dichotomy. In this sense, in silico dimension could be considered as a natural extension of the classical dichotomy. From the way in which simulation is used on in vivo-in vitro dichotomy, we also suggest that the general idea of simulation proposed by Hartmann have to be redefined. The intuitive idea of simulation resting on “imitation” relationship, as a “process that imitates another process” (Hartmann 1996), has to be complemented by others methodological concepts like “isolation” or “disruption”.},

Bajo el liderazgo de Frederick Gowland Hopkins este grupo tenía como objetivo primario la consolidación de la naciente bioquímica. Una característica particular de este grupo fue el intento explícito de vincular el trabajo científico con la discusión filosófica. Sin embargo, algunos historiadores como Nils Roll-Hansen (1984) han cuestionado en duros términos la manera en la cual estos científicos apelaban a la filosofía. En particular Roll-Hansen ha sugerido que los aspectos filosóficos del trabajo de estos investigadores tendrían un mero carácter propagandístico vinculado con el proyecto de la constitución de la bioquímica como una disciplina.  En este trabajo voy a defender que es posible considerar a los principios filosóficos presentados por la escuela de Cambridge como algo más que una mera propaganda para un proyecto institucional. Para esto voy a comparar la relación entre los principios filosóficos y trabajo metodológico propuesto por la escuela de Cambridge con una propuesta contemporánea: el Análisis de Control Metabólico, una perspectiva en el estudio de la bioquímica cuyo trabajo metodológico se suele defender apelando a “principios filosóficos”. A pesar de la distancia temporal entre ambas escuelas, tanto la actitud de apelar a principios filosóficos como el campo de estudio científico son semejantes.

However, some historians like Nils RollHansen  (1984) have harshly questioned the way in which these scientists  appealed to philosophy.

In this paper I am going to defend that it is possible to consider the  philosophical principles presented by the Cambridge school as something  more than a propaganda for an institutional project. To this end I am going to  compare the relationship between the philosophical principles and  methodological work proposed by the Cambridge school with a contemporary  proposal: the Metabolic Control Analysis, a perspective in the study of  biochemistry whose methodological work is usually defended by appealing to  “philosophical principles”. Despite the temporal distance between the two  schools, both the attitude of appealing to philosophical principles and their  field of scientific study are similar.},

  abstract = {This paper describes the results of experimental tests in co-injection of precipitant agent/oil through a flow-loop setup to measure and characterize the deposition of precipitated asphaltenes along in-line test section. To do this, a novel experimental flow loop setup was designed and constructed to carry out the turbulent flow of oil (Re up to ≈7500) at desired oil-precipitant volumetric dilution ratio (DR), volumetric rate of flow and radial temperature gradient of the test section. Since the formation of deposit layer makes it difficult for the oil flow along the tube, change in pressure difference across the test section of setup was recorded along the time to measure the amount and extent of deposition process at desired condition. The experimental results revealed that, while radial temperature gradient of tube does not affect deposition process much, increasing the velocity of fluid across the tube further sweeps the precipitated particles from vicinity of wall before they have enough time to stick in contrary to oil-precipitant ratio; where the deposition rate is enhanced with increasing DR. Furthermore, these observations were thoroughly analyzed and with utilizing the concept of deposition efficiency, a new mathematical model proposed and verified for prediction of asphaltene deposition rate. The results of this work provide better insight into dynamics of asphaltene deposition and could create a better framework for conducting forthcoming experiments and developing new models of asphaltene deposition in pipelines.},

  abstract = {An equation-of-state (EOS) fluid characterization has been developed to model three-hydrocarbon-phase equilibria as part of the enriched-gas EOR research program for the Kuparuk hydrocarbon miscible flood on the Alaskan North Slope. Laboratory experiments with Kuparuk reservoir oils and miscible injectants have identified an apparent second equilibrium liquid that is heavier than the original oil and macroscopically reversible. A three-phase EOS fluid characterization was developed to match both two- and three-phase experimental data by use of a modified Peng-Robinson EOS. Experimental observations identified a relationship between the third phase and the oil's pentane-insoluble fraction. The characterization uses a total of 16 components, with the heaviest two approximating the pentane-soluble and pentane-insoluble portions of the C36+ fraction. The properties of these heavy pseudocomponents control the development and behavior of the heavy phase. The EOS fluid characterization was used to study three-phase, enriched-gas-drive displacement mechanisms. For the Kuparuk fluids, a condensing/vaporizing displacement mechanism is predicted in a three-phase environment. Reservoir-condition micromodel displacements were conducted to observe the phase-behavior and displacement mechanisms during Kuparuk enriched-gas displacements. Micromodel observations are consistent with a near-miscible condensing/vaporizing mechanism and qualitatively agree with EOS predictions.},

  abstract = {While the pursuitworthiness of philosophical ideas has changed over time, philosophical practice and methodology have not kept pace. The worthiness of a philosophical pursuit includes not only the ideas and objectives one pursues but also the methods with which one pursues them. In this paper, we articulate how empirical approaches benefit philosophy of science, particularly advocating for the use of qualitative methods for understanding the social and normative aspects of scientific inquiry. After situating qualitative methods within empirical philosophy of science, we discuss how to adapt these traditionally sociological methods to empirically inform philosophical questions. Our aim is to normalize and legitimize qualitative methods for philosophical purposes and discuss how they can elucidate descriptive and normative components of scientific practice in a more generalizable non-idealized manner. We contend that qualitative methods are particularly well suited to philosophical interest in the social norms of science, their achievability, and their mutability. Furthermore, unlike more historical case studies in philosophy, qualitative methods enable more confidence in generalizability, albeit limited, from a concrete sample to a larger class. We conclude by addressing anxieties about the distinctness of empirical philosophy of science from social epistemology and from sociology of science.},

Particularly, I argue that his quantitative style of reasoning has mistakenly been viewed as a form of robustness reasoning, whereas I believe it is something different, what I call ‘calibration’. From this perspective, I re-evaluate recent interpretations of Perrin provided by Stathis Psillos, Peter Achinstein, Alan Chalmers, and Bas van Fraassen, all of whom read Perrin as a robustness reasoner, though not necessarily in the same sort of way. I then argue that by viewing Perrin as a ‘calibration’ reasoner we gain a better understanding of why he believes himself to have established the reality of atoms and molecules.

Replication studies have been presented as a way of directly supporting theory development by enabling researchers to more confidently and precisely test and update theoretical claims. In this article I use contemporary work from philosophy of science to make explicit and emphasize just how much theory development is required before ?good? replication studies can be carried out and show just how little theoretical payoff even good conceptual replications offer. I suggest that in many areas of psychology aiming at replication is misplaced and that instead replication attempts are better seen as exploratory studies that can be used in the cumulative development of theory and measurement procedures.},

  abstract = {Abstract. As a part of an integrated improved oil recovery project, it was required to evaluate asphaltene formation arising from contacting nitrogen gas with the reservoir fluid. This paper discusses the experimental work associated with the asphaltene evaluation.The subject reservoir was known to have operational problems due to asphaltene precipitation during primary production. Hence, laboratory experiments using the transmittance of an optimized laser light in the near infrared (NIR) wavelength (\textasciitilde 1600 nm) were used to first define the pressure-temperature regions of asphaltene instability of the reservoir fluid. Subsequently, several light transmittance experiments were conducted to evaluate the asphaltene instability regions by contacting various molar concentrations (5, 10, \& 20\%) of nitrogen gas with the reservoir fluid. Also, measurements were conducted to quantify the bulk precipitation of asphaltene with various molar concentrations of nitrogen.Results indicated that nitrogen gas aggravated the asphaltene instability, and also, increased the bulk precipitation amount with increasing concentrations of nitrogen gas in the reservoir fluid. The aggravated asphaltene instability could potentially nullify any expected benefits of improved oil recovery with nitrogen injection as pressure maintenance.},

  abstract = {A fairly common problem encountered during petroleum hydrocarbon production has to do with asphaltenes. Under reservoir temperature and pressure conditions, the asphaltenes remain in solution. When the stability of the colloidal suspension is affected, asphaltene materials can precipitate. Changes in pressure, temperature and/or composition of the oil have the potential to destabilize the asphaltene particles. The problems encountered by the precipitation of the particles in the production process create operational difficulties that vary from the plugging of tubulars and flowlines to separators. The minimization of the solids problem is not a well understood mechanism. The authors are convinced that a unified solution has not been found yet, mainly because scientists and engineers lack a fundamental understanding of the thermodynamic process leading to solids flocculation. Remedial action can only begin once the conditions favorable to the beginning of the nucleation or flocculation of asphaltene particles have been properly identified. The determination of the onset of asphaltene nucleation conditions has been effected through several laboratory techniques, including the gravimetric method, fluorescence spectroscopy, conductive measurements, fibre optics, light scattering, and acoustic resonance techniques. The oil characteristics affect most of the techniques previously mentioned. Some factors, such as oil color for example, directly influence the choice of a particular method. It is obvious that the light-scattering technique, using a light wavelength in the visible range is not adequate in the case of dark colored oils. Near-infrared (NIR) light spectrum is called for, since the visible lights are absorbed and are rendered unable to detect any phase change phenomenon. The authors discussed the advantages and disadvantages of using the gravimetric method, the acoustic resonance technique (ART) and NIR technique. It was noted that ART has been successfully used by the authors to determine the onset of asphaltene nucleation/flocculation pressure.},

Doping the rods with copper (II) sulfate increased the signal response for the saturate and aromatic fractions and resulted in a decrease in the relative standard deviation of the measured peak areas for all four SARA fractions. Comparison of precipitated asphaltenes and column chromatographic separation of the maltene fraction with Iatroscan data is problematic because resins are typically occluded in the precipitated asphaltenes and polar fractions appear to have variable flame ionization detector (FID) response factors.},

Field deposits and crude oil from the same well were collected for analysis. Compositional differences between field deposits, lab-generated capillary deposits, and C7-precipitated asphaltenes were determined by Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS), and all three samples show similar trends in composition, displayed as plots of aromaticity versus carbon number. An enrichment of highly condensed aromatic molecules for the field deposit is detected with both ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry and thermal cracking experiments and could predict asphaltene deposition. FT-ICR mass spectral analysis of solvent-extracted fractions suggest different deposition mechanisms for field deposits (slow deposition) compared to rapid precipitation in standard asphaltene preparation protocols that contain trapped maltenes.}

I argue that PR is a precondition for what I call ‘result robustness’ (RR), which refers to the traditional sense of experimental robustness, namely, the existence of convergent experimental results obtained through different and independent means of detection. Furthermore, I argue, PR and RR constitute useful experimental strategies in the context of high-energy physics experiments, but these strategies are not without limitations.},

  abstract = {What kinds of norms constrain mechanistic discovery and explanation? In the mechanistic literature, the norms for good explanations are directly derived from answers to the metaphysical question of what explanations are. Prominent mechanistic accounts thus emphasize either ontic (Craver, in: Kaiser, Scholz, Plenge, Hüttemann (eds) Explanation in the special sciences: the case of biology and history, Springer, Dordrecht, pp 27–52, 2014) or epistemic norms (Bechtel in Mental mechanisms: philosophical perspectives on cognitive neuroscience, Routledge, London, 2008). Still, mechanistic philosophers on both sides agree that there is no sharp distinction between the processes of discovery and explanation (Bechtel and Richardson in Discovering complexity. Decomposition and localization as strategies in scientific research, MIT Press, Cambridge, 2010; Craver and Darden in In search of mechanisms: discoveries across the life sciences, University of Chicago Press, Chicago, 2013). Thus, it seems reasonable to expect that ontic and epistemic accounts of explanation will be accompanied by ontic and epistemic accounts of discovery, respectively. As we will show here, however, recent discovery accounts implicitly rely on both ontic and epistemic norms to characterize the discovery process. In this paper, we develop an account that makes explicit that, and how, ontic and epistemic norms work together throughout the discovery process. By describing mechanism discovery as a process of pattern recognition (Haugeland, in: Having thought. Essays in the metaphysics of mind, Harvard University Press, Cambridge, pp 267–290, 1998) we demonstrate that scientists have to develop epistemic activities to distinguish a pattern from its background. Furthermore, they have to determine which epistemic activities successfully describe how the pattern is implemented by identifying the pattern’s components. Our approach reveals that ontic and epistemic norms are equally important in mechanism discovery.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Asphaltene deposition is a flow assurance problem that threatens the continuous production of crude oil. This problem is likely to get worse because of the current tendency to produce from deeper waters and also due to the implementation of enhanced oil recovery operations based on miscible injection of CO2 or hydrocarbon gas.In this article we present a review of the asphaltene precipitation and deposition problem in oil production, and we describe the commercial techniques used for its determination and quantification as well as their limitations. We also discuss the important progress achieved concerning modeling tools with enhanced capabilities that have been developed to forecast the occurrence and the magnitude of this problem. Prompt recognition of potential asphaltene deposition issues, either for new fields or as part of enhanced oil recovery projects, is necessary to implement successful prevention or mitigation strategies. Unfortunately, current commercial inhibitors have mixed results in the field and in some cases are responsible for worsening the deposition problem. After a thorough investigation we have elucidated a multi-step mechanism of asphaltene precipitation, aggregation and aging, which explains the poor performance of some chemicals and the limited capabilities of the current testing protocols. We provide some ideas for a new generation of asphaltene inhibitors and, for the cases in which asphaltene deposition has already occurred, we also provide a list of common techniques and best practices used for its remediation.With this work we aim to provide the reader with a broad understanding of this complex problem and to offer a starting point for the development of cost/effective strategies to manage asphaltene deposition in increasingly complex environments.},

First, if one can show that a result is robust, and that the various individual models used to derive it also have other confirmed results, these other results may indirectly confirm the robust result. Confirmation derives from the fact that data not known to bear on a result are shown to be relevant when it is shown to be robust. Second, robustness may increase the degree to which the robust result is indirectly confirmed if it increases the weight with which existing evidence indirectly confirms it. This may happen when it strengthens the connection between the core and the robust result by showing that auxiliaries are not responsible for the result.},

  abstract = {A unified approach to evaluating asphaltene precipitation based on laboratory measurement and modeling is presented. This approach used an organic deposition cell for measuring asphaltene drop out onset conditions. Asphaltene precipitation was detected by changes in optical fluorescence, electrical conductance, and visual observation. A series of experiments measured the effects of changing pressure, temperature and composition on asphaltene precipitation. A fully-compositional V-L-S mathematical model completed the analysis by matching the experimental results. The model was then used to forecast asphaltene precipitation under a variety of production scenarios including response to gas-lift operations, and to evaluate the possible location of a tar-mat.An organic deposition cell (ODC) was developed to experimentally detect asphaltene drop out onset. Two different detection techniques were incorporated into the cell. Fluorescence spectrometry has been used to study aromatic compounds. Fiber optics allowed application of this basic technique to asphaltene detection in the ODC. Conductance measurements were also incorporated into the ODC.Thermodynamic models have been used to predict asphaltene precipitation from reservoir crudes under a variety of conditions. Burke et al and others applied polymer solution theory to the prediction of asphaltene precipitation. While this technique has been very successful, it is limited in its capability to predict the amount of asphaltene precipitate and varying precipitate composition. It was therefore decided to use the more rigorous approach presented by Thomas et al to model asphaltene precipitation. This method is based on an earlier wax deposition model which allows a fully compositional representation of the asphaltene phase.The high-pressure (6000 psig) I high-temperature (250 F) ODC employed a piston to allow sample or chemical introduction and pressure/volume control(Figure 1). The piston was designed to minimize dead volume so that flashing during sample introduction was reduced. Heating elements and cooling coils were installed for temperature control. The sapphire window allowed limited visual inspection and the use of a flexible fiber optics probe for luminescence detection. The cell was rocked to allow sample mixing and could be inverted so the window was on top. Electrical conductance was measured between the cellwall and the conducting probe. The conductance values obtained included a high background contribution from the equipment.},

The second component of this chapter moves beyond descriptions of the consequences of uncertainty to discuss how scientists have sought to decrease and understand model-based uncertainties. Practices examined include the use of model ensembles in various forms (multi-model, large single model, and perturbed parameter), benchmarking, out-of-sample testing, and machine learning. Also explored are the philosophical discussions related to these practices, commenting on interpretations of model pluralisms, the epistemic opacity of machine learning, and the epistemic role of models in informing decisions related to adaptation and resilience.},

  abstract = {Multiple derivability (MD) is an inductive strategy to increase the reliability of a theory (Nederbragt, Studies in the History and Philosophy of Biological and Biomedical Sciences, 34:539, 2003). It may be considered as the strategy with which a theory is supported by evidence obtained by two or more independent methods that differ in background knowledge and technical principles on which they are based. As such, MD is a member of a family of comparable strategies to which also belong robustness, triangulation and consilience of inductions. Triangulation may be roughly defined as the use of the same or a different method, both in an independent manner, to describe an object. Consilience of induction may be described as occurring under the circumstance that a hypothesis explains two or more known or unknown (classes of) independent facts. It may be argued that robustness is the result of MD, triangulation and consilience; this will be investigated in more detail. Robustness may come in degrees. This can be argued when using the definition of MD in which emphasis is given to theoretical and technical independence of two methods that make it possible to infer the same theory. The degree in which two methods differ in this background and principles determines the degree of robustness. I will confront this with analyses of replication and confirmation. Finally, obtaining robustness by MD may not be possible. I will illustrate this by discussing a case of immunohistochemical staining of microscopical slides. Some robustness on the level of the method itself may be possible but not on the level of the theory. In that case stability of the theory is dependent on social interactions between theory, scientist and the science community.},

The results show that, to demonstrate this invasion, many experimenters used two or more methods that were based on independent technical and theoretical principles, and by doing so improved the reliability of the theory. Subsequently I compare this strategy of ‘multiple derivability’ with other strategies, discussed in the literature in relation to the mesosome, a bacterial organelle that had been detected with the electron microsope, but which appeared later to be an artifact. I propose that different strategies have been applied in this problem, and multiple derivability may have been the decisive one. Finally I discuss the idea that multiple derivability may help to anchor theories in a larger network of theories.},

We clarify the concepts of generality, realism and precision and argue that there is no necessary conflict among them.

  abstract = {Dilution onsets are an attractive and convenient way to study the tendency of asphaltenes to precipitate from a given crude, since they do not require high-pressure equipment and dead oil samples utilized are quite easy to get in comparison to bottom hole samples. In addition, the so-called indirect method developed and proposed in the last decade presents some advantages over previous direct methods, mainly that precipitation of smaller particles can be detected without complications. This technique was implemented in this work as a first study of onsets for Argentinian crudes, considering two light and two medium viscous oils, with n-pentane and n-heptane as precipitating agents. Several aspects of the method implementation are discussed, and special attention is paid to the dilution of the supernatant after centrifugation. It was observed that dilution of the supernatant in toluene should be adjusted according to oil density. Onsets were detected not only for the two heavier fluids with important asphaltene contents, but also for one of the light oils studied. In agreement with previous publications, it is seen that a shorter and more volatile alkane, in this case n-pentane, anticipates the onset in comparison to n-heptane. The use of the measured onset for tuning a compositional model for the reservoir fluid is illustrated for a light oil produced from the Vaca Muerta Formation. Nevertheless, it is shown that the type of compositional information used as input for characterizing the heavier fractions can have an important impact on the prediction of the asphaltene precipitation behavior at high pressures.},

  abstract = {As discussed in chapter 1, reservoir fluids are in the forms of natural gases, gas condensates, volatile oils, and black oils. As shown in Table 1.1, these fluids contain hydrocarbons from C1 to compounds with carbon number greater than 50. Composition of a reservoir fluid is generally expressed in mol\% of nonhydrocarbon compounds (id est, H2S, CO2, N2), C1, C2, C3, nC4, iC4, nC5, iC5, C6, and C7+. The boiling range of reservoir fluids can be greater than 550C (>̃1000F). Crude oil is produced by separating light gases from a reservoir fluid and bringing its condition to surface atmospheric pressure and temperature. Therefore, crude oils are generally free from methane and contain little ethane. The main difference between various reservoir fluid and produced crude oil is in their composition, as shown in Table 1.1. Amount of methane reduces from natural gas to gas condensate, volatile oil, black oil, and crude oil while amount of heavier compounds (id est, C7+) increase in the same direction. Characterization of reservoir fluids and crude oils mainly involves characterization of hydrocarbonplus fractions generally expressed in terms of C7+ fractions. These fractions are completely different from petroleum fractions discussed in Chapter 3. A C7+ fraction of a crude oil has a very wide boiling range in comparison with a petroleum product and contains more complex and heavy compounds. Usually the only information available for a C7+ fraction is the mole fraction, molecular weight, and specific gravity. The characterization procedure involves how to present this mixture in terms of arbitrary number of subfractions (pseudocomponents) with known mole fraction, boiling point, specific gravity, and molecular weight. This approach is called pseudoization. The main objective of this chapter is to present methods of characterization of hydrocarbon-plus fractions, which involves prediction of distribution of hydrocarbons in the mixture and to represent the fluid in terms of several narrow range subfractions. However, for natural gases and gas condensate fluids that are rich in low-molecular-weight hydrocarbons simple relations have been proposed in the literature. In this chapter types of data available for reservoir fluids and crude oils are discussed followed by characterization of natural gases. Then physical properties of single carbon number (SCN) groups are presented. Three distribution models for properties of hydrocarbon plus fractions are introduced and their application in characterization of reservoir fluids is examined. Finally, the proposed methods are used to calculate some properties of crude oils. Accuracy of characterization of reservoir fluids largely depends on the distribution model used to express component distribution as well as characterization methods of petroleum fractions discussed in Chapter 2 to estimate properties of the narrow boiling range pseudocomponents.},

We demonstrate how the practice of evaluating measurement uncertainty serves to render any such evidential circularity epistemically benign. Our analysis shows how the evaluation and deployment of uncertainty evaluation constitutes an in practice solution to a particular form of Duhemian underdetermination that improves upon Duhem's vague notion of “good sense,” avoids holism, and reconciles theory dependence of measurement with piecemeal hypothesis testing.},

  abstract = {Asphaltene molecular size and weight have been of concern since asphaltenes were first isolated from crude oils. Despite previous divergent results on this topic, in recent years, there has been a growing consensus among all mass spectral ionization techniques and all diffusion measurements that asphaltenes are fairly small molecules. In this paper, fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) is used to determine translational diffusion coefficients of asphaltene and model compounds under a variety of conditions. These FCS studies provide several stringent tests on asphaltene molecular size and architecture. A broad range of concentrations including ultralow concentrations is investigated to ensure the lack of potential aggregation difficulties. Large temperature variations are used to test the application of the simple diffusion equation. FCS results here clearly show the dependence of the diffusion constant on the molecular weight. Finally, FCS results on asphaltenes are in quantitative agreement with those of time-resolved fluorescence depolarization on asphaltenes. A comparison of the results herein with previous FCS and time-resolved fluorescence depolarization (TRFD) results on the same asphaltenes confirms the correlation between molecular size and asphaltene chromophore size; this supports a molecular architecture with one or two polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) per molecule and counters proposed structures with many PAHs per asphaltene molecule.}

My conjecture is supported with multimodal evidence: the clouds, the barometer, the season. The term “multimodal evidence” will be unfamiliar to most, though it is a common intuition that multimodal evidence is valuable. A “mode” is a way of finding out about the world; a type of evidence; a technique or study design. We usually have evidence for or against a hypothesis which comes from a variety of different modes; I call this multimodal evidence. For example, when devising his laws of motion, Newton had evidence on the orbits of the moons of Jupiter and Saturn, the patterns of spring and neap tides at the solstice and equinox, and terrestrial dynamics.},

  abstract = {A technique to quickly determine the asphaltene onset pressure (AOP) of a crude oil from low‐volume, nonequilibrium measurements is presented. The pressure at which the optical signature indicative of asphaltene aggregation is first detected in recombined crude oils is found to decrease strongly with the rate of depressurization and can be well‐described with a modified power law. This technique exploits this rate dependence and uses two separate decompressions at highly disparate depressurization rates to determine the AOP. Benchmarking with this technique was performed with recombined crude oils that were characterized with conventional pressure/volume/temperature analysis. Using this technique, measurements enabling the determination of the AOP of a live crude oil can be obtained in minutes with a nominal uncertainty of 500 psi. This is a significant reduction in time compared with the multihour process used for conventional equilibrium‐based measurements. Onset‐time data from these studies are consistent with conventional aggregation theories, but there is insufficient range to differentiate between reaction‐limited aggregation (RLA) and diffusion‐limited aggregation (DLA).},

  abstract = {Asphaltene precipitation in reservoirs during production and Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) can cause serious problems that lead to reduction of reservoir fluid production. In order to study asphaltene tendency to precipitate and change in flow rate as a function of distance from wellbore, an equation of state (Peng-Robinson) based model namely Nghiem \emph{et al.{$<$}i/{$>$}’s model has been employed in this study. The heaviest components of crude oil are separated into two parts: The first portion is considered as non-precipitating component (C\textsubscript{31A+{$<$}sub/{$>$}) and the second one is considered as precipitating component (C\textsubscript{31B+{$<$}sub/{$>$}) and the precipitated asphaltene is considered as pure solid. For determination of the acentric factor and critical properties, Lee-Kesler and Twu correlations are employed, respectively. In this study, a multiphase flow (oil, gas and asphaltene) model for an asphaltenic crude oil for which asphaltene is considered as solid particles (precipitated, flocculated and deposited particles), has been developed. Furthermore, effect of asphaltene precipitation on porosity and permeability reduction has been studied. Results of this study indicate that asphaltene tendency to precipitate increases and permeability of porous medium decreases by increasing oil flow rate in under-saturated oil reservoirs and dropping reservoir pressure under bubble point pressure. On the other hand, asphaltene tendency to precipitate decreases with pressure reduction to a level lower than bubble point pressure where asphaltene starts to dissolve back into oil phase. Moreover, it is observed that precipitation zone around the wellbore develops with time as pressure declines to bubble point pressure (production rate increases up). Also, there is an equilibrium area near wellbore region at which reservoir fluid properties such as UAOP (Upper Asphaltene Onset Pressure) and LAOP (Lower Asphaltene Onset Pressure) are constant and independent of the distance from wellbore.}}}},

  abstract = {Asphaltenes represent one of the major potential flow assurance problems in the upstream oil industry. Asphaltene precipitation determination is a key step in studying the asphaltene deposition problems because precipitation is a necessary condition for the asphaltenes to deposit. In this work, a novel experimental technique called the “indirect method” is used for studying asphaltene precipitation on both model oil and real crude oil systems. This method, which is a combination of gravimetric and spectroscopic techniques, is proposed for the detection and quantification of asphaltene precipitation in dead oil samples. The term “indirect” refers to an indirect detection of the precipitation of asphaltenes, by measuring the absorbance of the supernatant fluid after centrifugation of oil/n-alkane mixtures. The results obtained in this study show that the indirect method has three main advantages over direct methods. First, it can be applied to detect asphaltene precipitation and also to quantify the amount precipitated. Also, it can be used for crude oils ranging from very low to high asphaltene content; model oils studied in this work contained 0.1–5 wt \% asphaltenes. Finally, the minimum particle size that can be detected with the indirect method is smaller than with the direct methods, and therefore, we can conclude that the indirect method is more sensitive than the direct methods. Different aging times, from 1 h to 1 month, were used in this study, and the results demonstrate that no single concentration of precipitant can be identified as the asphaltene precipitation onset. Detection of asphaltene precipitation depends upon the aging time of the samples, and this time dependency is related to the minimum particle size separated by the centrifugation process. A detailed study on the relation of the aging time and the centrifugation speed is necessary as a future work.}

  abstract = {Contemporary thinking about science remains in the grip of the long standing ideal of exact natural laws. This ideal fits with a second dogma. In the 19th century scientists became acutely aware that humans introduce error in making observations. Not just random error. Also systematic error. For example, pairs of trained astronomers of impeccable credentials were sometimes found to differ systematically in their observations, despite their best efforts. The solution to this distressing situation seemed to be to get people out of the observation-making business as much as possible. Efforts were made to mechanize observation. One can imagine what a stir the discovery of photography must have caused! 1 The photograph provides a good icon: The ambition has been to produce a perfect likeness of nature, a perfect model. The natural law ideal can be seen as the theoretical side of this more general enterprise, complemented by efforts to get untainted observations. Of course characterizing our efforts to describe nature as aimed at producing a perfect model is itself a model of the human knowledge-gathering enterprise. Hence we may call it the Perfect Model Model. 2. AN ALTERNATIVE TO THE PERFECT MODEL MODEL The metaphor of the Perfect Model Model is, to be sure, an exaggerated representation, intended to call to mind an attitude realized by various combinations of more specific slogans such as ‘(exact, exceptionless) natural laws’, ‘comprehensive theories’, ‘reduction’, and ‘convergent realism’. Today the many careful advocates of such views acknowledge the need for refinement. But a few of us take three reasons for caution to indicate that the Perfect Model Model should be scrapped entirely. First, nature may comprise no ultimate refinement of structure, encodable in finitely statable natural laws. Second, even supposing wonderfully simple and universal laws, including a complete description of forces and dynamics, such laws},

  abstract = {Abstract. Asphaltene precipitation and subsequent deposition is a potential problem in oil production because the significant costs for wellbore cleaning and the associated production loss. To better understand the mechanisms by which asphaltenes precipitate and deposit, in this work we present experimental evidence that supports the idea that precipitation and aggregation of asphaltenes is a multi-step process, where the former is driven primarily by thermodynamics whereas the latter is driven by kinetics. Under this multi-step mechanism, asphaltene precipitation is a fully reversible process. On the other hand, from the precipitated phase, subsequent aggregation and aging leads to the formation of more solid-like structures. Furthermore, we also present experimental results that suggest that the currently available commercial technologies to detect asphaltene precipitation (i.e. NIR spectroscopy and High Pressure Microscopy) might not be appropriate to detect the exact point of asphaltene precipitation, but instead they give a combined reading of precipitation plus aggregation. For this reason, the results obtained using these methods are very sensitive to the depressurization rates. The better understanding of the asphaltene behavior has enabled the development of an enhanced modeling approach based on the Perturbed Chain version of the Statistical Associating Fluid Theory equation of state (PC-SAFT EOS), which is used to predict the precipitation of asphaltenes at reservoir conditions and requires fewer simulation parameters than previous methods. A case study is presented in which our modeling technique was proven useful for the detection and correction of inconsistencies in experiments done using a bottom-hole sample at reservoir conditions.},

Understanding the processes that control asphaltene deposition, especially the relationship between precipitation and deposition, can help to reduce the risk and cost. Stainless steel capillary tubes were used to study the influences of factors including temperature, degree of asphaltene instability, and precipitant molar volume on asphaltene deposition from mixtures of stock‐tank oils and n‐alkanes. Temperature varied from 20°C to 60°C. Pressure drop across the capillary tube was used to estimate the amount and distribution of deposit formation. Existing asphaltic particles in stock‐tank oil samples did not create deposits. Below the wax appearance temperature, intermittent pressure spikes indicated deposition of wax. Above the wax appearance temperature, deposition occurred gradually from near‐onset mixtures created by co‐injection of oil and n‐alkane precipitants. Asphaltenes flocculated by addition of higher molar volume n‐alkanes deposited more material than those flocculated by lower molar volume n‐alkanes. Examination of the deposited materials showed that they contained not only asphaltenes but also waxes. Much different depositional characteristics were observed for solutions of asphaltenes in an aromatic solvent than for the stock‐tank oil from which they were derived.},

Experimentation is taken to be relevant to confirming, rather than interpreting, the transmission theory. But the construction of Morgan’s theory went hand-inhand with the reconstruction of the chief experimental object, the model organism, Drosophila melanogaster. This raises an important question about theoretical knowledge gained in laboratory settings: when a theory (such as the theory of classical genetics) is constructed to account for phenomena in a carefully controlled laboratory setting, what knowledge, if any, indicates the theory’s relevance or applicability to phenomena outside highly-controlled settings? The answer, I argue, is found within the procedural knowledge embedded within laboratory practice.},

To determine whether a theoretical result actually depends on core features of the models and is not an artifact of simplifying assumptions, theorists have developed the technique of robustness analysis, the examination of multiple models looking for common predictions. A striking example of robustness analysis in ecology is the discovery of the Volterra Principle, which describes the effect of general biocides in predator-prey systems. This paper details the discovery of the Volterra Principle and the demonstration of its robustness. It considers the classical ecology literature on robustness and introduces two individual-based models of predation, which are used to further analyze the Volterra Principle. The paper also introduces a distinction between parameter robustness, structural robustness, and representational robustness, and demonstrates that the Volterra Principle exhibits all three kinds of robustness.},

  abstract = {Willard van Orman Quine once said that he had a preference for a desert ontology. This was in an earlier day when concerns with logical structure and ontological simplicity reigned supreme. Ontological genocide was practiced upon whole classes of upper-level or ‘derivative’ entities in the name of elegance, and we were secure in the belief that one strayed irremediably into the realm of conceptual confusion and possible error the further one got from ontic fundamentalism. In those days, one paid more attention to generic worries about possible errors (motivated by our common training in philosophical skepticism) than to actual errors derived from distancing oneself too far from the nitty-gritty details of actual theory, actual inferences from actual data, the actual conditions under which we posited and detected entities, calibrated and ‘burned in’ instruments, identified and rejected artifacts, debugged programs and procedures, explained the mechanisms behind regularities, judged correlations to be spurious, and in general, to the real complexities and richness of actual scientific practice.},

  abstract = {Analytic philosophers once pantomimed physics: they tried to understand the world by breaking it down into the smallest possible bits. Thinkers from the Darwinian sciences now pose alternatives to this simplistic reductionism.In this intellectual tour--essays spanning thirty years--William Wimsatt argues that scientists seek to atomize phenomena only when necessary in the search to understand how entities, events, and processes articulate at different levels. Evolution forms the natural world not as Laplace's all-seeing demon but as a backwoods mechanic fixing and re-fashioning machines out of whatever is at hand. W. V. Quine's lost search for a "desert ontology" leads instead to Wimsatt's walk through a tropical rain forest.This book offers a philosophy for error-prone humans trying to understand messy systems in the real world. Against eliminative reductionism, Wimsatt pits new perspectives to deal with emerging natural and social complexities. He argues that our philosophy should be rooted in heuristics and models that work in practice, not only in principle. He demonstrates how to do this with an analysis of the strengths, the limits, and a recalibration of our reductionistic and analytic methodologies. Our aims are changed and our philosophy is transfigured in the process.},

  abstract = {I review the scientific situation with the emergence of population biology that led Richard Levins to introduce the idea of looking for robust theorems, and the influences that lead Donald Campbell to introduce “triangulation”. My review tied these two notions together, and looked for other convergent methodologies that showed some of the same characteristics I baptized as “robustness analysis”. I review the main types, and then turn to a further characterization of material robustness, which has become the primary focus of studies in biology and elsewhere in the last decade. I discuss one key source of this robustness—sexual recombination—and then close with some remarks on robustness, complexity, fragility, and generative entrenchment.},

  abstract = {In recent years, a worldwide reduction in economically recoverable conventional petroleum reserves has led to an increase in exploration and production activity in heavier crude oils. In Canada, up-graders have been required to deal with more accessible, but difficult to process, heavy oils and bitumen from oil sands. In order to optimize plant operating conditions and assess their impact on the environment, a thorough knowledge of the molecular structure and behaviour of the source petroleum is needed. The problems associated with hydro-processing of fractions rich in nitrogen is of particular concern.The approach applied here involves separation of a series of diversified Canadian crude oils (oil sands bitumens plus heavy and conventional oils) into asphaltenes and maltenes, followed by further fractionation of the maltene components by High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). This approach differs from conventional SARA (saturates, aromatics, resins, asphaltenes) separation in that multiple fractions are easily separated on the basis of polarity differences thereby providing more detailed information on component class distribution. The separated fractions are subjected to characterization by various analytical methods, including: gel permeation chromatography (GPC) for number average molecular weight determination, molecular parameter calculation using CHNS analyses in combination with \textsuperscript{1{$<$}sup/{$>$}H and \textsuperscript{13{$<$}sup/{$>$}C NMR spectroscopy and group analysis by peak deconvolution of X-ray photo-electron spectra (XPS). The bitumens comprise less saturates but more resins and asphaltenes than any of the other heavy oils tested. Conversely, the conventional crude is associated with the highest saturates content and the least amount of resins and asphaltenes. Yields of aromatic fractions from different sources all fall within a relatively narrow range. It is noteworthy that the SARA fractions from each oil produced relatively similar bulk property values. All of the resin fractions contained more than 40\% of the total nitrogen, i.e., greater than the amounts contributed by the corresponding asphaltene fractions. For the resin sub-fractions relatively minor differences between molecular weights, atomic H/C ratios and aromaticity were observed. The substantial difference in the HPLC elution behaviour for these subfractions appears to be attributable to the asymmetric distribution of polar nitrogen compounds for material collected at longer elution times. This observation may allow selective removal of intractable nitrogen compounds, possibly leading to cost savings through improved catalyst utilization in a modified upgrading process.}}},

  abstract = {For accurate determination of asphaltene flow assurance, the importance of asphaltene-onset pressure (AOP) as direct information from live oil is undisputed. For this purpose, the standard has been to use a single-phase bottomhole sample, even though this is expensive. This fluid sample stores information most closely representing in-situ asphaltene conditions. Because of its costly collection, the handling and examination of such samples are conducted carefully to avoid inconclusive results and/or wastage; however, unexpected experimental difficulties sometimes result in the failure of AOP detection. In our AOP-measuring experience, the most modern method—laser light scattering (LLS)—has been applied because of its convenient and quick procedure. Our measuring equipment consists of a solid detection system (SDS) that uses LLS to determine AOP using the power-of-light-transmitted (PLT) function. In addition to the SDS, the apparatus also consists of other simultaneous measuring functions: high-pressure microscopy (HPM), which can be used to visually observe asphaltene particle count and size, and a densitometer and viscometer to investigate fluid kinetics. In this work, the HPM and viscometry measuring functions were demonstrated as useful supporting techniques to determine AOP in cases when SDS PLT results cannot be used alone. This work demonstrated that data acquisition should be maximized and as much information as possible should be obtained from the costly sample. AOP interpretation that is based on each type of data can be aligned in an order related to the asphaltene particle size and growth because the detection limits of each measurement are reflected in the AOP interpretation. In summary, comprehensive interpretation can achieve a higher-quality estimate of AOP: Different measurements give different interpretations that can be used in a synergistic manner.},
