**Whereas in section 5 a full detailed case study is practiced, for now one example may suffice so that the same simple and basic logic can easily be applied to any scientific model, since, again, it is extremely usual for any scientist or science theorist. Suppose a model to explain the water cycle in a given region has the following concepts or unitary elements: a mountain, a river, a lake, clouds with a certain concentration, an underground channel through which water moves, the atmosphere and water in certain concentration depending on their state. The model could be much more complex and complete, nothing prevents it from being so. It should also be clarified that it will necessarily contain other non-unitary elements that will help constitute the whole of the model. But now it is interesting to highlight these unitary elements in their interaction and affirm that the model makes sense iff there are things, in the place assigned as the target, which serve as objects for each unitary concept of the model: there must be a mountain with the characteristics that the model has considered relevant to survey, a river, eventually clouds, etc., and all interacting homologously to how the corresponding concepts interact in the model. This could be not the case, and then the model is just wrong since it represents a possible target, but in this case not real nor realizable. The criteria for evaluating models from this account is thus subordinated to the in-practice criteria that scientists have for evaluating models in general.**
